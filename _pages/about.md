I am a bioinformatician with a PhD who decided to learn full-stack web development. My goal is to develop web applications of any kind, from on-line portfolios, to e-commerce, to data analysis and visualization apps. I also enjoy writing, so I am recording my journey through learning web development on <a href="https://tpaternina.github.io" target="_blank">this blog</a>. 

Besides coding, I am interested in the intersection between personal development, fitness and well-being, human and animal rights, and the environment.

The letters on my logo are my initials: TPO for Toni Paternina Osorio (we hispanics have two last names).



Feel free to contact me on my LinkedIn or via email.

Cheers!
