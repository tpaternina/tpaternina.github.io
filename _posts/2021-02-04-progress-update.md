excerpt: After one month learning the basics of web development, I take a look at my progress so far.
---

It is the end of the 5th week of my web development learning path, so I thought it was time to take a step back and assess how my progress has been so far. I started with turbo mode on and filled with optimism, but the last weeks I have experienced some uncertainty and doubt.

## A bit of context about me

Before diving in, I want to share some things about my past and my personality. I have always been a good student. I know how that may sound, so I just want to be clear. I am _not_ bragging or trying to feel superior to others. This is just my experience through the education system. 

I picked up things quite fast at school, especially in the so called "hard" sciences and languages. I wasn't the most organized or the most hard-worker, but this capacity to understand concepts fast got me good grades and a reputation of being intellectual. Full disclosure, I didn't have a clean record of straight A's, as there were some subjects I didn't understand right away (especially those that needed memorizing) or I wasn't fully interested in. All in all, I did fairly well and was among the top students of my class, from elementary school up till my Master's degree. I put in the hours of work to finish my higher education, but I always felt in my comfort zone.

### The breaking point: a thesis dissertation

After graduating, I started a job as a bioinformatician in a molecular biology lab in Paris. The work environment was amazing, and the subject matter was super interesting to me, so I decided to pursue a PhD. This academic experience was nothing like the one I had during my education. 

During my PhD, I had short-term and medium-term goals. The only long-term goal on my bucket list was writing my dissertation, so it was hard for me to picture what was coming. 

Unlike my classes at school or at university, or even at graduate school, the work during my PhD wasn't graded. I did not have quantifiable feedback, only positive or negative results. That's normal, after all, when you do research you are trying to discover things or develop new methods. Most of the time you don't find anything, which doesn't mean you're failing; when you do find something, it's hard to evaluate with a score, as this novelty may not have a grading score (yet).

As you may guess, this situation was all new to me. Even though I had the help and advice from my supervisors and my tutor, I was not in my comfort zone. I was doing things and working to get results without knowing if it was good or bad. I was growing a bad case of impostor syndrome.

It all unraveled when it was time to sit down and write my dissertation. This was the most massive project I had ever worked on. As one of my supervisors said, the thesis manuscript is like a mountain. It is huge, but with a map to guide you, and the consistency to climb it, you can reach the top. I was paralyzed. It took me a while to write the structure of the manuscript. Once I completed it and started writing the actual thing, I still felt insecure about what I was producing. Was I being accurate? Was I forgetting to include something? Is this going to be enough for the jury, for my supervisors, for me?

In the end, it all worked out. I completed the manuscript, I defended my thesis, and I was granted a PhD from one of the top institutions in France. I proud of this accomplishment because it was one of the hardest things I have ever done. But for the same reason, thinking about those last months, awakens the bad feelings I went through at the time.

## Learning full-stack is not a path of roses

If that title sounds weird to you, it's probably because I translated it from Spanish literally and shamelessly. Something not being a _camino de rosas_ (a path of roses) means that something isn't smooth, easy, a _walk in the park_.

As you can read on my [first post]({% post_url 2021-01-04-starting_my_next_adventure %}), I was full of optimism thinking that becoming a full-stack developer would be a path of roses. Trying to code the navigation bar of this website from scratch on my own, without looking at the original code, was all it took to come back to earth.

I understand HTML and CSS, and programming with JavaScript [wasn't that hard]({% post_url 2021-01-29-learning-javascript-ii %}) after spending years programming with Python. But the basics of these languages is not what front-end web development is about.

Among the resources provided by Codecademy, there is this roadmap by [@kamranahmedse](https://twitter.com/kamranahmedse) to learn front-end development:

{% include image.html url="https://roadmap.sh/roadmaps/frontend.png" description="Skills to learn to become a front-end developer, found on www.roadmap.sh/front-end" %}

According to this roadmap, and Codecademy's progress bar, I'm not even a quarter of the way to learning front-end development. I thought I knew CSS, but there's still so much to learn in order to make things look as I want them to look (or as a client or designer would expect them to look). On top of that there is accessibility, responsive design, designing a layout, making a website interactive with Javascript, learning a Javascript framework, learning a CSS framework, and then just keep learning as new technologies and frameworks appear. And this long list is only the front-end stretch of the full-stack development path that I want to follow!

Because of the amount of new skills to get, and the current pace that I am able to keep, this all feels like another big mountain to climb. It is only natural to have flashbacks of my thesis writing months. I have a roadmap now, as I did back then. But, also as back then, I find myself full of doubts: did I choose the right roadmap to follow? Am I going to be good enough after I finish? Will I find the job I want once I gather the skills?

## Keep calm and carry on has to become my mantra

I don't know the answer to any of those questions. What I do know is that I have climbed a mountain before. I have felt the same insecurity and uncertainty. I have been out of my comfort zone and did the job I had to do. I reached the top of the mountain taking one step at a time.

To all the inner voices that are afraid of going through all of that again, I have to actively respond "be patient, trust the process". I know this may sound all _New age_, believe-in-yourself BS. But if I want to become a full-stack developer, I have no choice but to keep working, doing the best I can every day. As I keep on learning, new things will become more familiar and easier, and the amount of things to learn will eventually decrease!

With each day that passes, it is clear to me that I am not going to finish the Codecademy career path in 4 months, as I initially expected. Actually, from the start that felt like an ambitious goal. Rushing into doing things I am not yet familiar with will only bring frustration and waste my time. I need to accept this and just keep going.

Have you ever experienced something like this? Which decisions made you step out of your comfort zone? How does working outside your comfort zone feel?

I may open a comment section here as soon as I find out how to stop bots and fight trolls. In the meantime, you can contact me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/tonipaternina) and share this post.
