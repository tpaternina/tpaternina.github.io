excerpt: Why I started learning web development instead of looking for a job as a Bioinformatician
---
 
 The year 2020 was tumultuous for many reasons. France entered a full lock down in march due to the rapid spread of Covid-19. This meant spending several weeks in isolation in my small 17 m2 studio, while attempting to wrap up the last data analyses for my PhD. Time went by, and as I prepared to write my thesis manuscript, I had the worst case of self-doubt and imposter syndrome I have ever had. With the support of my supervisors, I did manage to complete the manuscript and send it off to my reviewers, which was a huge relief. However, as I prepared my defense, my mom fell ill and depended on me to take care of her (she has successfully recovered, thankfully). I still managed to prepare decent slides and, although my presentation was not as fluid as I would have liked, I managed to defend my manuscript and was granted a PhD from one of the top [higher education institutions in France](https://www.ens.psl.eu/en/ens/facts-and-rankings/international-rankings).
 
 To say that my path to graduation was a bumpy road is an understatement. All the obstacles, wrapped in the general uncertainty that the pandemic brought, took me to very dark places. Yet, I am grateful I went through that experience witout losing loved ones, and keeping my physical health. Also, my PhD mentors and living through the pandemic helped me decide to **finally** take the steering wheel of my life. 
 
 Through most of my early adulthood, I have felt like I have been sleepwalkig, procrastinating, and wondering where my life was going. Looking back, I felt that many of the important decisions I had made were just the easy, low-risk way to go. It felt like I was investing most of my time on building an academic career that, despite being interesting, was far from being my passion. I have been putting aside the things that excite me, prioritizing the path laid out in front of me rather than making my own path.
 
 I cannot even recall the number of times I have tried to learn web development. When it was time to choose an undergraduate degree, I confused my interest in molecular biology with what I truly wanted to do as a career. And so I spent three years learning about DNA, proteins, how everything is organized inside the cell, even our bodies metabolism. But all along I was more interested in computers, and was not completely happy with the way I was investing my time.
 
 This pushed me to find a way to learn more about programming, without having to start another Bachelor's degree from scratch. For this reason, I thought pursuing a Master's degree in bioinformatics would reconcile my interest in biology with my neglected interest in development and web technologies. This was true, but only to a certain extent.
 
 Again, I let other interests prime over web development. I specialized in DNA sequencing data analysis, and pursued a PhD to optimize the data analysis of a technology that allows to detect protein-RNA interactions at a large scale. Web development did not fit in this equation. I honed my programming and data analysis skills during the three years of my PhD, but I did not manage to specialize in web development.
 
 So here I am, three months after finishing my PhD, at an inflection point of my life. Many people around me had a job or a plan for the next step in their career. Not me. Though that may be frustrating or scary for some, I welcomed this as an opportunity to dedicate time to my other interests, mainly, web app development. As I write this paragraph, I am at 10% of Codecademy's full stack development career path.
 
 Full disclosure, I am not paid to promote Codecademy in particular over other learning platforms. My decision to follow this "career path" was based on several aspects. First, I considered the price of the Pro subscription quite affordable (less than 20â‚¬ per month), with a discount for yearly subscriptions. In my case, I chose a monthly subscription, as I expect to master web development in less than one year! Before signing up, I had tried Codecademy's Javascript course for free, and I enjoyed the simultaneous theory vs. practice methodology they offer. I decided to pay a Pro subscription to have access to career paths, quizzes, and projects. Because, I will be honest, you can only truly learn a new skill with practice.
 
 Unlike a school program or a college degree, one aspect of online learning that I value is time flexibility. With Codecademy, like with many other online platforms, I can invest as many hours a day as I want, and take as much time as I need to complete a course. Finally, as I am learning on my own, I need a structure I can follow. Following separate tutorials for free, which offer flexibility and would save me some money, would not be an efficient option for me because of the lack of structure (or because I would have to figure out such structure by my self). However, I am sure some people have succeeded in becoming web developers following tutorials online for free, so do not take my path as the only valid one towards becoming a developer.
 
 So, what do I expect from this experience? To begin with, I set myself the ambitious goal of finishing the Full stack career path in 3 months, which is probably too ambitious. With my current pace through the first sections, I would probably take more than that. Plus, my pace may grow slower as I start learning more concepts I am not yet familiar with, so I may be looking at more than 4 months to complete. In any case, I plan on completing the course in less than 6 months. On my first day, I finished the introduction of the course and set up this blog using Github pages. Let's see how I will keep up!
 
 If you're reading this, thank you for taking the time to find out about my experiences and motivations. I hope I was able to inspire you or make you feel seen if you are going through something similar.
 
 Until next time!
