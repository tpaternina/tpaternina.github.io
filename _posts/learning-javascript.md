1. Intro

2. Basics
- Getting familiarized with the syntax not so hard.
- Some similarities to Java syntax that I studied during my master's
- With the small practices, easy to get used to the specific way of writing code in javascript relative to python.

- Reviewing basic concepts of coding like variables and data types, functions, and conditional statements.

- Unlike Python, declaring 2 types of variables with let and const. Reminiscent of Java, but unlike Java, no need to declare the type of the variable.

- surprised by the mltiple ways of writing a function. Declaration, assignement, arrow functions, simplified syntax... @.@

- I went through these sections quite quickly thanks to my experience with programming. 

3. Intermediate

- Things got gradually serious. This section had concepts I knew and introduced new ones that I thought I knew but were harder to get familiarized with.

- Loops, no problem, for loop syntax identical to Java for loops. Reviwed while loops and learned do while syntax.

- Scope: which variables can be _seen_ b different blocks of code.

- Objects...initially sntax reminded of Python dictionaries. Key-value pairing of variables, with possible different data types. tese are called properties of the object.
- But objects can also have methods, so in this sense it felt like writing a class. 
- However, unlike writing a class, there are different ways to write an oject. Literal writes an instance of an object, no constructor. If you want a similar object you copy properties and modify, or write a function that returns an oject. 
- You can also write a constructor, wich feels more like writing a class! For convention, constructors start with capital letter, and are called with the new statement!
- All objects in javascript inherit prperties and methods from the Object class. So, you can also call the Object constructor and add the properties and methods like so: (example)
- Objects are very versatile and can become very complex. An object can contain other objects as properties (show example), or have arrays of objects (show). There are many more things to say about objects and object methods (the this object, getters and setters), but I wll probably talk more in depth about them in a future post.

4. Opinion about projects 

- for someone with experience in coding, the basic concept exercises felt a little repetitive, but it's understable as part of a course that teaches to code from scratch.

- I feel I made theright choice to subscribe and have access the projects, quizzes, and practice lessons. They allow to test your own ideas to solve problems, check documentation independently, and the concepts from the theory to really sink in.
