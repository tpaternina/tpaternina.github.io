A website is built with 3 basic ingredients: HTML for the content, CSS for the style, and Javascript for interactivity. My journey towards web development starts with javascript. In this post I am going to summarize my experience learning the basics of Javascript.

Before I dive in, I need to give full disclosure. As I mentioned in [my first post]({% post_url 2021-01-04-starting-my-net-aventure %}), I went to graduate school to learn bioinformatics, and thus get closer to computer science. This means I am not new to coding. I first learned to implement algorithms with Python. I got introduced to Object Oriented Programming (OOP) with Java. Then, I learned statistics and machine learning with R. During my PhD, I developed my command line skills with bash, and analyzed my data with Python (thank you Pandas, Seaborn, and scikit-learn). 

I don't mean to brag about my skills, but to be clear about my perspective. My experience here is going to be different from someone who just started to learn to code, or from someone that has been coding in C++ for years and has decided to learn web development. I am not a newbie, but I have tons to learn!

With that in mind, let's talk about the basics of Java script. 

I started the Codecademy free version of the Javascript course back in November. Before taking a big pause to help my family move houses, I went through around 40% of the modules. Luckily, when I subscribed to the Pro version of Codecademy, my Javascript progress was taken into account for the Full-stack developer career path. So, technically, I didn't need to go through the Javascript modules I had completed. 

But that would have been too easy.

Because I had made a big pause, I decided to go through the basics *again*, to fully grasp the characteristics of the language. This included variable declaration, data types, functions, and conditional statements.

Spoilers: it wasn't thrilling. 

Getting familiarized with the syntax of Javascript is not too hard when you have had some experience with Java. Now,to be clear, they are not the same *at all*. But they do share some similarities in how we declare and modify variables:

```javascript
let emptyVariable;
let variable =  0;
variable += 2;
const message = 'You rise with the Moon, I rise with the Sun.';
```

As I python-head, I was not used to declare variables with the keywords `let` and `const`, nor to end my lines with semicolons. Also, knowing some Java, I noticed that
